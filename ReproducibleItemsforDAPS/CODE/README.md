File | Description
---|---------------------------------------------------------------------
betweenwithin.Rmd | explores between vs. within subject exposures to NO2 and PM10
DAPS_Data_Cleaned.Rmd | file to process and clean raw data for output into useable files
DAPS_DataCleaning.Rmd | DO NOT USE preliminary form of data cleaning and processing
DAPS_ExpMonComparison.Rmd | code for correlations and correlation plots of NO2, PM10, O3, and gluc/endo monitors
DAPS_ExpMonComparison2.Rmd | code for mean bias, variance, and seasonal variation between monitors
DAPS_monitor_results.Rmd | DO NOT USE preliminary form of exposure monitor comparisons. 
DAPS_Regression_Output.Rmd | code to create DAPS_OUTPUT1.csv, to use before OUTPUT_TABLE_CODE.rmd
Graphics_Exposures.R | makes basic seasonal boxplots of exposures
OUTPUT_PLOTS.Rmd | used to create plots of Coefficient/IQR for relative comparison of exposures. Requires DAPS_OUTPUT2.csv
